\noindent\textbf{Abstract}

Adapting songs for karaoke video games is a complex process that requires musical knowledge, which results in a limited number of songs available. Taking advantage of advances in artificial intelligence, thanks to which it is possible to solve problems with computer systems that previously required the intervention of a human, this work aims to facilitate the adaptation of songs by advancing in its automation.

To this end, using agile development, a Python application has been implemented that, from the audio of a song, estimates the tones of each note performed by the singer and saves them in a file with the standard \texttt{UltraStar} format for karaoke video games, with greater precision than existing solutions. Additionally, the library developed to work with the \texttt{UltraStar} format can be used independently by other projects.
